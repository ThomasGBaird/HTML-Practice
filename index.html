      <h1>Welcome to my first solo build site using basic HTML</h1>
      <p>On this site, I will display my knowledge of HTML basics</p>
      <p>In the mean time, I'll tell you about my cats!</p>
      <h2>My cats</h2>
      <p>My wife, Hannah, and I have three cats. Their names are Biscuit, Beignet, and Fritter.
        Here is a little bit about each of them.</p>
      <h3>Biscuit</h3>
      <p>Biscuit is the oldest of our three cats. We got him in the Fall of 2015
        from a lady that Hannah knows who found him at her house. He has a grey colored coat with short, wispy hair.</p>
      <p>Some of Biscuit's favorite things to do are...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run around in the backyard</li>
        <li>Play with his little brother, Fritter</li>
        <li>Nap with Hannah</li>
        <li>Hide under the bed when it's time to go to bed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Beignet</h3>
      <p>Beignet is the second oldest of our cats, and the only girl. We adopted her and Fritter
        at the same time from Reidville Road Animal Hospital. She is about a month older than Fritter,
        but probably about a year younger than Biscuit. She has a blond colored coat with short, soft hair.</p>
      <p>Here are some of Beignet's favorite activities</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Napping (and lots of it)</li>
        <li>Eating (she's the fattest of our cats)</li>
        <li>Licking Hannah's face and fingers</li>
        <li>Sitting in her kittie chair by the window</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fritter</h3>
      <p>Fritter is the youngest cat in the bunch, be he is by far the roundest.
        He has a little head but a big heart. Some days he gets needy and wants lots of attention,
        but others he is happy to just do his own thing. He has a black coat with short, silky hair.</p>
      <p>Fritter likes to...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Play with his big brother, Biscuit</li>
        <li>Lay on the endge of the bed with one leg hanging off</li>
        <li>Stare at the fish tank</li>
        <li>Stetch his legs</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A day in the life of our cats</h3>
      <p>Here is a small look into our cats daily schedule</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Meow at mommy and daddy's door until they open up</li>
        <li>Eat breakfast</li>
        <li>Run around the house as loudly as possible</li>
        <li>Nap with mommy</li>
        <li>Eat their leftovers (if there are any)</li>
        <li>Nap until daddy gets home from work</li>
        <li>Play until it's dinner time</li>
        <li>Play some more</li>
        <li>Cuddle with mom and dad until it's time to go to bed</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I hope you enjoyed getting to know a little bit about my cats. I enjoyed
        telling you about them</p>
